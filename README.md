# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## About Project
This project is related to the Expenses bar change over a period of time.<br>
The header contains the Form to add the expenses to the EXPENSE LIST. It has a very cool functionality to open and close the form.<br>
Next, we have a Year Filter, which shows the EXPENSE LIST according to the selected year.<br>
Then we can see a chart bar which shows the expenses in all the months in a BAR CHART FORM.<br>
At last, we have the Expense List which shows the list of all the expenses according to the filter.<br>

Please take a look at the video to get an overview:
